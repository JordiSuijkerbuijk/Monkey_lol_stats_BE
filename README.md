# Monkey_lol_stats

## Tasks

### Get team Stats

- Inside this task we are collecting all the recent match history of the monkeys. Based on our own set variables we will create a object that we will save to firebase for later reference. To run it install this 'npm install -g ts-node typescript '@types/node'. Then run 'ts-node getTeamStats.ts';.

# TODO:

- Check the possibilities to return errors from service/controllers. Maybe
  using an error type.
